# Project Title

Source code related to blog post about creating custom parseable format styles in iOS 15 (and similar versions of tvOS, watchOS, and macOS). 

## Description

With iOS 15 (and the latest versions for watch, iPad, etc.), we can now convert certain values such as dates and numbers to strings much more easily while still maintaining specific control over the process. This project shows a brief example of creating a parseable format style for a custom phone number object that can be used with new initializers for the SwiftUI TextField.
